            <p><strong>Robotics Researcher - Senai CIMATEC (2023-Present)</strong></p>
            <p>Functions: Develop locomotion strategies for soft robots using tendon drive, pneumatic drive and in an underwater environment. In addition to submitting to an event or journal scientific publication(s) with the results obtained in the proofs of concept.</p>

            <p><strong>Robotics Researcher - Senai CIMATEC (2022-2023)</strong></p>
            <p>Functions: Study and apply autonomous localization and navigation techniques for electricity generation and transmission facilities in order to improve the efficiency of the maintenance processes involved; improve reliability and reduce economic losses caused by failures; and reduce the occupational risks related to this activity. To this end, it will make use of the various combined sensors (LiDAR, cameras, GPS, etc.) that have been selected to integrate the SUBOT robot prototype and compare them according to their performance in different environments: outdoor and indoor.</p>
